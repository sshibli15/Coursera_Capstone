Description of Data and its usage in resolution:

We will explore and evaluate similarities and dissimilarities among Toronto, New York and Paris. There are various approaches 
that could be followed, one of them is studying the venues around the cities within the radius of 1000 meters. Instead of studting
individual venues, the count of venue category is found more useful for city to city comparasion. 

Since our analysis of similarities among cities are based upon the venues around the city thus we decided to use only the 
foursquare database instead of several other available sources. The major benefit of doing so is that same definition of venues, 
venues categories, location, etc. definition irrespective of the indiviual cities are used. The foursquare data is most comprehensive 
database for geographical locations with plenty of attributes that could be used for any kind of location based study. The Foursqare 
offers various endpoints, endpoints groups that can be used in venues, users related searching, exploring, trending, and etc.

We may use various endpoints groups but we will be using foursquare endpoint for venue exploration only to study the venues 
categories to evaluate similarities in Toronto, New York and Paris. After combining venues we calculate the frequencies of the 
venues categories for each city within the radius around 1000 meter. The reference location is city center of each city and venues 
are captured accordingly. A frequency distribution of the count of the venues are used to access the similarities. The closer the 
frequency venue categories the similar the cities are to each other.
